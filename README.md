# diffusion-pipe
A pipeline parallel training script for diffusion models.

Currently supports Flux, LTX-Video, and HunyuanVideo.

**Work in progress and highly experimental.** It is unstable and not well tested. Things might not work right. I haven't tested it on Windows, as I use Linux exclusively for all my ML dev work.

## Features
- Pipeline parallelism, for training models larger than can fit on a single GPU
    - There's currently a bug that prevents pipeline parallelism from working with HunyuanVideo
- Full fine tune support for:
    - Flux
- LoRA support for:
    - Flux, LTX-Video, HunyuanVideo
- Useful metrics logged to Tensorboard
- Compute metrics on a held-out eval set, for measuring generalization
- Training state checkpointing and resuming from checkpoint
- Efficient multi-process, multi-GPU pre-caching of latents and text embeddings
- Easily add support for new models by implementing a single subclass


## Installing
Clone the repository:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/tdrussell/diffusion-pipe
```

If you alread cloned it and forgot to do --recurse-submodules:
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Install Miniconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/

Create the environment:
```
conda create -n diffusion-pipe python=3.12
conda activate diffusion-pipe
```

Install the dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training
**Start by reading through the config files in the examples directory.** Almost everything is commented, explaining what each setting does.

Once you've familiarized yourself with the config file format, go ahead and make a copy and edit to your liking. At minimum, change all the paths to conform to your setup, including the paths in the dataset config file.

Launch training like this:
```
NCCL_P2P_DISABLE="1" NCCL_IB_DISABLE="1" deepspeed --num_gpus=1 train.py --deepspeed --config examples/hunyuan_video.toml
```
RTX 4000 series needs those 2 environment variables set. Other GPUs may not need them. You can try without them, Deepspeed will complain if it's wrong.

If you enabled checkpointing, you can resume training from the latest checkpoint by simply re-running the exact same command but with the ```--resume_from_checkpoint``` flag.

## Parallelism
This code uses hybrid data- and pipeline-parallelism. Set the ```--num_gpus``` flag appropriately for your setup. Set ```pipeline_stages``` in the config file to control the degree of pipeline parallelism. Then the data parallelism degree will automatically be set to use all GPUs (number of GPUs must be divisible by pipeline_stages). For example, with 4 GPUs and pipeline_stages=2, you will run two instances of the model, each divided across two GPUs. Note that due to a weird bug I'm still investigating, pipeline_stages>1 doesn't work with HunyuanVideo.

## Pre-caching
Latents and text embeddings are cached to disk before training happens. This way, the VAE and text encoders don't need to be kept loaded during training. The Huggingface Datasets library is used for all the caching. Cache files are reused between training runs if they exist. All cache files are written into a directory named "cache" inside each dataset directory.

This caching also means that training LoRAs for text encoders is not currently supported.

Two flags are relevant for caching. ```--cache_only``` does the caching flow, then exits without training anything. ```--regenerate_cache``` forces cache regeneration. If you edit the dataset in-place (like changing a caption), you need to force regenerate the cache (or delete the cache dir) for the changes to be picked up.

## HunyuanVideo LoRAs
HunyuanVideo doesn't have an official Diffusers integration yet, and as such it doesn't have an official LoRA format. This script currently outputs the LoRA in a format that directly works with ComfyUI. You will need to use [this PR](https://github.com/kijai/ComfyUI-HunyuanVideoWrapper/pull/72) in the HunyuanVideoWrapper extension until it gets merged.

## Extra
You can check out my [qlora-pipe](https://github.com/tdrussell/qlora-pipe) project, which is basically the same thing as this but for LLMs.
